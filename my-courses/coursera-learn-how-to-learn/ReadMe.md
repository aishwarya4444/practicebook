Learn How to Learn
------------------

## Modes of Learning
- Focussed
- Diffused

## Procrastination
- Engaging youself in less priority works than more priority items
- Escape path like facebook which gives comfort for sometime
- Pomodoro Technique

- Importance of exercise in learning
- Importance of sleep in learning
	- Sleep removes all toxins from mind and allows fresh approaches
	- Sleep contracts the nerurons and allows toxins to pass away

## Chunking
- It is easy to move chunks from working memory to long term memory
- A chunk is a set/network of joined/wired neurons that are used for firing together to perform action smoothly 
- Chunking helps your brain run more effectively
- In order to perform an action, we may need multiple chunks depending upon the complexity of the action. The more complex the action is, the more number of chunks we get from long terms memory into working memory and hence the more time it takes.
- Sometimes an action is stored in multiple chunks while some actions can be stored in single chunk.
- The more we practice, the more amount of information gets saved in chunk. Hence, the retrieval is faster.

### How to Form a Chunk ?
- Focussed attention
- Pattern
- Understand the basic concepts (Visual Pattern)
- Developing a context when to use what.
- Recall (Remebering things without looking at content)

Science/Math problems can be learnt better when we practice them with closed books.
When we see a picture, it does not mean we can do it.
Doing is the only solution which can be done after which you can say - you can do it.

### Two Types of learning:
- Top Down Learning: Looking at a solution and defining chunks. 
- Try taking a picture walk through the material/content to gain bigger picture context before lecture/conferences (Top Down Learning) 
- Bottom up learning: Using chunks to explore solution. Solving smaller parts to solve complete problem.

### Recall vs Chunk Mapping
- Recall: Tool to visualize/remeber somethings happened in past. One of the most efective techniques.
Even better than chunk mppong
- Underlining and Highlughting are keypoints of learning something new but prevent yourself from doing lot of highlighting/underliining.
- Recall is more effective when textboksa are closrd.

### Illusion of Competence: 
- Number of hours spent on a book/work does not define the amount of learning.
- To Avoid this, test yourself (Recall)
- Minimize highlighting
- Use deliberate practice

### Transfer: 
- Chunks allows us to understand new concepts. e.g. Chunks in learning Physics can be similar to some concept in maths/chemistry.
As we practice more of a subject, we form a library of chunks and it becomes easier to solve a problem in that field.
With practice, more information can be compactly stored in single chunk. 

### Overlearning: 
Overlearning can be useful in some cases like public speaking, sports etc
But we should not overlearn in single session.

### Interleaving 
Practicing several skills together. Jumping between them in different sessions. Learning will be good if those skills are related
This is a great technique because when we practice different sets of problems after reading, we get to learn the concepts very much.
Makes strong neural patterns.

Interleaving: Learn some basic skills first and then start learning several similar skills together.
Blocking: Learn each skill one by one and do not start another unless you master the first.

### Article about Interleaving
http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-interleaving-effect-mixing-it-up-boosts-learning/
The gist of which, I think is 'certainly walk before you can run, but, as soon as you can walk, start working on hopping, skipping and jumping.

### Einstellung (Mindset): 
- When we have already formed a neural pattern, then subsequent thoughts tend to follow that neural pattern.
So it is important to unlearn if we have learnt something wrong.

Initial Idea prevents better ideas.

### Law of Serendipity: Lady luck favors the one who tries.

## Procrastination & Memory

### Habit 
When mind is in zombie mode, it saves energy for us. For example: Once we know how to ride bicycle, our brain knows how to do it. We don't need to put additional effort anymore. 

Habits can be good or bad.

### 4 parts:
1. Cue: Trigger the habbit. Can be good/bad depends on how we respond to it.
2. Routine: Actions we take in habit
3. Reward
4. Belief: Need self belief that we can change bad habit

### My Answer to PROCESS vs PRODUCT
I am doing a side project along with my job and I have just started it. Often while working, I get lots of negative feelings what if people won't use it or all my effort is going to be wasted etc.

To get rid of these feelings, I have developed few milestones and defines certain tasks in each milestone and I am focusing only on task one by one and achieving milestones there after. This is PROCESS where I am concerned about doing small items in short sessions.

PRODUCT, refers to entire finished product which looks to be lengthy.

### How to be more effective ?
- Maintain a weekly list of items
- Maintain ToDo list for each day and try to prepare list for next day by previous day evening
- Try to estimate each task's time and slowly you will estimate correct time
- Always plan your quitting time (Number of hours you put in a day)
- Try to do most difficult/disliked task first day in morning (for atleast one pomodoro) - aka Eat your frogs first

### Diving Deeper into memory
- Try to relate things with visual image/context
- We tend to remember things easily in visual space
- Reconsolidation - Process to move memory from Working Memory to Long term memory
- It is possible to generate false memories in a brain through reconsolidation (Happens during sleep)
- Hippocampus: Responsible for retaining new memories
- Memories are not fixed but living, breathing parts of your brain that are changing all of the time. 
- Whenever you recall a memory, it changes, a process called, reconsolidation. It is even possible to implant false memories, which are indistinguishable from real ones by simply suggesting and imagining, especially in children who have vivid imaginations. 
- Astrocytes: Plays important role in learning. Einstein's brain had more astrocytes than avg human brain. Provide Ion balance to neurons. 
- Space repitition is very important to place things in long term memory

### Card Game (Recall)
- Write important letter on one side of card and rest of the details on other side of card
- Try to recall information from just seeing front side of card
- Then shuffle the cards (multiple subjects) and try to recall information in jumbled order: Interleaving 

### Memory Palace Technique
- To enter into memory visual system
- Identify a palace for your memory (Home, School, Office etc)
- Try to associate each item you are learning with different items in your palace
- Initially the process is slow but study confirms that students using this technique are able to remember about 90-95% in just 1-2 practice sessions

### Create Meaningful Groups
- Associate numbers with something with you
- Patterns
- Handwriting is very effective technique to develop neural patterns in mind

## Renaissance Learning and Unlocking your potential

- We are born with few neurons and New Neurons are formed as we learn
- New neurons die if they are not used for sometime
- Exercise is an effective way to help survive the neurons (Much more effective than any drug to help you learn better)
- Learning, Planning, Leanguage are the skills that make us humans
- Prefrontal Cortex affects social behavior, ability for complex analysis, ability to make decisions, ability to plan etc.
- PC: Reaches maturation in early adulthood

### Metaphors and Analogy
- Execllent way to remeber and retain things for long time
- Metaphors are never perfect
- Allow us to get rid of Einstellung (Getting stuck in doing a thing in a particular one way)

### Imposter Syndrome
- When highly achived individual thinks that his achievements are fluke and has constant fear that he can be proved "fraud"
- He thinks he has achieved something which he does not deserve.

### Importance of Teamwork
- Right hemisphere:
- Left Hemisphere: Interprets the things.
- Friends and team mates can catch what you miss
- Explaning to them help you understand
- Brainstorming

### Test Checklist
- Testing is a wonderful technique to focussing your mind

### Hard Start Jump to Easy Technique
- Star with hardest problem triggers the focussed mode and then qiuckly switch to easy ones once you are stuck.
- Easy problems are solved with diffused mode
- Helps to avoid einstellung
- Must have self discipline to switch to easy ones when you are stuck
- Efficient technique - Allows different parts of brain to learn together

## Questions:
1. What is the effective way to form chunks ?
- Practice / Spaced repitition ?

## My Answers
### Do you take your learning seriously ? Do you think you spend enough time in praticing and studying ?
Answer: Yes, I take my learning seriously. I am always indulged in some form of learning whether it is sports, online course or some book.

No, I don't think I spend enough time practicing. Though I try but I used to avoid practicing much in order to cover the content faster but this course has made me realized the importance of practice and I will try to improve in this area.
