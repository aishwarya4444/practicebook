Dr. Robert Builder on Creativity and Problem Solving
----------------------------------------------------

- No Pain No Gain - also true for brain
- It is ok to get some discomfort when learning something new. Any physical or mental change causes some discomfort.
Once we cross that level of discomfortness, we start liking the subject.
That's why short introductory course/videos are very helpful or good way to start learning.
It removes your discomfortness from multiple areas/topics in the subject.

If you look at the content before attending a lecture, lecture seems really meaningful and you can understand more part of it.
Simply, because it has eased some level of discomfort in the mind about the new words.

How to build perceptions

Powers of 10 exercise/video
- Starts from human eye and takes you 100 times zoomed out until you reach in universe and similarly takes you 100 times zommed in until you reach sub molecular space and where you will it is another universe. Well, this could be another way of looking at problem. Look at overall picture of the problem and also go into very fine details found for the problem.

Octobus of attention - turns off in sleep
Octobus of attention has tentacles in very few mind spots when in focussed mode. We are mostly concentrating on only few things.
While in diffused or relaxed mode it spreads its tenacles in multiple areas and hence we can see the problem with different perspective as well.

Benny Lewis - The Irish Polyglot about learning languages
---------------------------------------------------------

- Polyglot: Knows multiple languages
- Children have one big advantage
- They are ok with making mistakes. They live the language
- Adults are Afraid of making mistakes that they do not speak at all

One important aspect of learning something is to "live" in it and not live "with" it.

Whether you think you can or can't, you are right - Henry ford
- He meant Self confidence is very powerful thing. He was literally making a bold statement to let others around him know that one of the primary keys to getting what you want out of life is believing that you can have it.

When we do not pass an exam, we say there is no point in studying and next time exam when we give exam with this mentality result becomes even worse So it is really necessary to stay positive. It is easy to get negativity about everything (literally everything).

When we say, I can't do this. That simple means the system(or approach) of doing/learning is not working for you. We need to form another approach or system to achieve what we want. e.g. If you learning a alnguage, avoid study based approach and try some practical approach like talking to people.

Mini mission brain melting technique
Pomodoro technique is great but we should know how many pomodoros we can do before we need a big break.
Continuos learning is not a gread idea. We definitely need a small/big break after some time to have an effective learning.

Mind Mapping
- Paper sideways (Very important) because it allows your brain to write anything
When we hold paper in portrait mode, our brain understand we are going to put outlines and list of things etc.
- A diagram with topic in central circle and keep on linking other things with this circle.

Outlines vs Mindmapping
- Instead of outlines we should choose mindmapping because it allows you to link multiple things and linking happens correctly.

Separate editing with writing
One big mistake people do while writing is that they do constant editing and it takes a lot of time to write.
While writing, we want brain to work in diffused mode and editing works in focussed mode like spell check, grammer check etc
Both can not work simultaneously. So it is always best to keep writing anf improve later on.

When writing, we want diffused mode to work to be more creative, get in flow.
