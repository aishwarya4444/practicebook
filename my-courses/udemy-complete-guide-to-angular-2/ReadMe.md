Udemy - Complete guide to Angular 2
-----------------------------------

## Angular Cli
- https://cli.angular.io/
- npm install -g angular-cli
- ng new my-app
- cd my-app
- ng serve

## Module
- A module is something which exports some code
- We import code from other modules

## Components
- @Component() decorator takes a JavaScript object as an argument and uses this argument to add some metadata (in the background) to this class.
- Similar to decorator pattern (Pizza factory)
- Backticks allows us to write multiline strings
- Strings can be used inline in template and styles as keys instead of templateUrl and stylesUrl

## Project Structure and Bootstraping
- main.ts is the code which is executed first
- We specify our root/top-level component in main.ts
- index.html is rendered as SPA
