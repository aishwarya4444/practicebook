Q. What is the difference between gradient ascent and gradient descent ?
Why did we chose gradient descent in regression technique and gradient ascent in classifier coefficients ?

Q. We stop gradient ascent/descent when change in âˆ‚l(w) in t iteration is smaller than some epsilon. 
How do we compute this change since the l is actually a vector.
