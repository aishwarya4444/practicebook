Innovation and Creativity
-------------------------

## Disruptive Business
- BigCompanies are often in dilemma to further strengthen their profits by investing more and adding new features to existing product or compete with small new company distrupting a segment of their business
- Ford had the same dilemma - Toyota posed threats in small cars. Ford had to choose to build big luxury cars for richers customers or compete with toyota in small cars. Toyota had the same issue with Chinese company entering into the segments
- One nice idea could be to build a separate version or division to compete in the segment and other division will keep on focussing on richer and high paying customers
