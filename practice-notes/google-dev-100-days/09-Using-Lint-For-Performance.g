Using Lint For Performance - Colt McAnilis
------------------------------------------

- Performance Issues can be fixed by running a inbuilt lint tool
- It comes with Android 1.0
- In Android studio, Analyze and then Inspect code will run the lint tool
- We can also configure lint to work in release build or every build or run it manually
- We can also configure it by Settings -> Performance (Editor -> Inspections) and tune the settings
	e.g I want "allocation in draw to be error"
