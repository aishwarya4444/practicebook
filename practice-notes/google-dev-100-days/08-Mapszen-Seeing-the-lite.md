Mapszen - Seeing the lite
-------------------------

- Problem Statement is showing a collection of places on UI
- First: Show markers on map itself
- Good solution if markers fit comfortably on screen
- if user has to scroll/zoom emphasis of the collection is lost

- Second: Providing a list of thumbnails of maps
- Lite Mode API
- Enable lite mode when instantiating Google Map options object
- Smaller memort and faster
