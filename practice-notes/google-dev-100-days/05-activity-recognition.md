## Description

There are over a billion Android devices in the world, and theyâ€™re packed with sensors. Android Activity Recognition fuses this sensor data together to provide a simple, low-power interface for apps to understand what users are doing. 

## Notes
- API allows us to identify if User is
	- running
	- inside a vehicle
	- walking
	- biking

- Provides a battery efficient solution

- Machine learning model is used in background and provides a result that with 75% onfidence user is running
Data is provided by sensors.

- We can build applications on top of this API like

	- When user stops the car and starts walking, saves the parking location
	- e.g. Google Fit
