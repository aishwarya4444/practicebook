Introduction to Voice Interaction API
-------------------------------------

- Google has defined some standard voice actions which google understand.
- App has to register on the action and Google accordingly open your app.

For example:
User: ok google, play me a song
Google: Which song do you like ?
User: Waca Waca

Now, Google will open which app to play song ?

This is determined by the actions and which app has registered on media action.
These actions are documented.
