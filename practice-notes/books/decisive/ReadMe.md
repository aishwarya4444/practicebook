- Try to talk to your partner on ways to improve your relationship

## Reality Test your Assumptions (R)
- Most acquisitions go bad due to CEO hubris (self confidence, giving importance to oneself) (Case of confirmation bias)
- On an avg they pay 41% higher premium for acquisitions and research showed three factors which affect the price a CEO buys another company:
	- Praise by media
	- Past progress
	- High salary
- Antedote to hubris is showing disagreement in decision
- Often many companies do not obtain any thridparty or independent viewpoint
- Someone opened a new restaruant in your neighbourboog with your fav food and have few 4 star reviews and couple of 1 star ratings. Which one would you read. High chances are your would read 4 star ones because you want the restaurant to be great. Classical example of confirmation bias.
