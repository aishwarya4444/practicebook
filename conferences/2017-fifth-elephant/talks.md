## Lessons from learning a nosql database
- Schema Agnostic Indexing (VLDB Paper)
- LSM vs BTree based data structure for persisting files
- Explore how a document is persisted
- Facebooks Unicorn

## Aerospike
- Aerospike paper (VLDB)
- Cluster formation in aerospike
- Paxos algorithm
- lockless data structures
- Secondary indexing in aerospike
- hybrid memory based system
- SSD and DRAM

## Distributed Consensus
- Google Spanner
- Tensorflow - Based on disbelief paper (Jeff dean)
- Paxos: Implements consensus, extremely complex algorithm
- Part time Parliament - Paper
- zookeeper also uses parts of paxos
- How traditional relational dbs are CA ?
- 2 commit and 3 commit protocols
- Non locking concurrency protocols
- Why nosql can not ACID
- Synchnoized clocks
- Spanner works on Google Infra only and they have implemented sync clocks
- Cockroach db - Spanner outside Google Infra

## Which database to choose
- Regunathb, fk, adhar, curefit
- 451research.com
- State of db landscape
- Paper: How spanner is becoming a new sql system ?
- Postgres --> Cockroack db
- Vitess: Built by youtube team. Gives sql interface over nosql store
- Check adhar architecture in slides
- Curefit: Titan with Cassandra
- BerkleyDB, Espresso, Facebook TAO
- Document Stores have challenges in data storage
- B Tree is better for inplace writes
- LSM Bteer for high perf writes
- Without schema understanding and querying of data becomes difficult
- Jepsen tests
- NFS vs HDFS
- FB Cold storage pattern
- Check deck

## Distributed Machine Learning
- pipalacademy
- porodata
- Firefly
- Grid search
- Data parallelism and Task Parallelism
- scikit allows you to parallelize but not on different computers

## ML from dev to prod
- Semantics3 (Works in ecommerce domain)

## Interactive Visualization using Markdown
