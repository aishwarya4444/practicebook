		- Opportunity Cose
		- Vanishing Options test
			- To figure out if you are not missing an important choice
	- Reality test your assumptions

	- Attain distance before deciding
		- What would your friend/successor do in this situation ?
		- Zoom out and zoom in
			- Zoom out: Try to see the situation from an external perspective
			- Zoom in: Get more details on the situations
			- Repeat above 2

## Widen your Options (W)

### Prevention Focus and Promotional Focus
- Prevention Focus: Avoid anything bad
- Promotional Focus: Take responsilbility/lead/charge
- Recent series of activities/events (Your mindset) impacts your decision
- Both are important
- Study about a women working in stressful job condition.
- Study about Staples and Office depot reacted to recession.
- this vs that - Better is choice is both
- Try to choose AND not OR

### What to do when you are unable to expand your options ?
- Vanishing Options test
	- Try to think what else you can do when you do not have currently available options.

### Alarming "whether or not" situations ?

Q1. "whether" I should leave the job ?
Q2. "whether" I should take divorce ?

Answer: Try to think to change the situation
- Try to talk to your boss for different set of duties
- Try to talk to your partner on ways to improve your relationship

## Reality Test your Assumptions (R)
- Most acquisitions go bad due to CEO hubris (self confidence, giving importance to oneself) (Case of confirmation bias)
- On an avg they pay 41% higher premium for acquisitions and research showed three factors which affect the price a CEO buys another company:
	- Praise by media
	- Past progress
	- High salary
- Antedote to hubris is showing disagreement in decision
- Often many companies do not obtain any thridparty or independent viewpoint
- Someone opened a new restaruant in your neighbourboog with your fav food and have few 4 star reviews and couple of 1 star ratings. Which one would you read. High chances are your would read 4 star ones because you want the restaurant to be great. Classical example of confirmation bias.


- We learn assessing the options to deal with confirmation bias
- confirmation bias is hunting for information which confirms our hypothesis or biasness

### Consider the opposite
- Ask discomforing questions
- e.g. What are the problems in this ?
- e.g. How many lawyers have exited the firm in last 5 years ?
